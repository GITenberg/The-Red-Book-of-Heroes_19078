description: Heretofore Mr. Lang and his wife have dealt largely with folk-lore and
  legendary romance; now they find it necessary to turn to reality. As a trade-mark,
  they adhere to the rainbow nomenclature, but ' The red book of heroes ' claims to
  be history, wherein the lives represented are marked by two dominant characteristics,
  honor and courage.Accounts of such heroes as Florence Nightingale. John Howard the
  philanthropist, Hannibal, Father Damien, the apostle of the lepers, the Marquis
  of Montrose, the little Abbess, and others. "It would surely be an abnormal child
  who would not welcome ' The red book of heroes ' among his Christmas gifts." - N.Y.
  Times "Mrs. Lang has a very pretty story-telling gift of her own. while Mr. Lang
  does his part in giving the books a background of scholarship." - The Outlook. This
  book is fully illustrated and annotated with a rare extensive biographical sketch
  of the author, Andrew Lang, written by Sir Edmund Gosse, CB, a contemporary poet
  and writer.
